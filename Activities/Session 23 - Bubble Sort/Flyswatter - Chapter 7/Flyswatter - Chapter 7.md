# Flyswatter Chapter 7 Vocab
1. An `____` allows you to store and work with multiple values of the same
data type.
2. The number inside the brackets is the array’s size `____`. It indicates the number of `____` , or values, the array can hold.
3. The individual elements of an array are assigned unique `____`.
These `____` are used to access the elements.
4. In working with arrays, a common type of mistake is the `____ ____`.
5. Arrays may be `____` when they are defined.
6. The series of values inside the braces and separated with commas is called an `____ ____`.
7. The range-based `___ ____` is a loop that iterates once for each element in
an array.
8. By using the same `____`, you can build relationships between data
stored in two or more arrays.
9. To pass an array as an argument to a function, pass the `____` of the array.
10. You can prevent a function from making
changes to an array argument by using the `____` key word in the parameter declaration.
