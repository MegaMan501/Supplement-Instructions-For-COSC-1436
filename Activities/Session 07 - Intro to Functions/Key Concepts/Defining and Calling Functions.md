# Key Concepts - Defining and Calling Functions

Make a concept-analysis model with four sections: key
concepts, properties/rules/processes, examples/non-examples, and
practice problems for defining and calling functions.

## Concepts
1. Name
2. Parameter list
3. Body
4. Return type

## Properties/Rules/Processes
1. The program can send data into a function. The parameter list is a list of variables that hold the values being passed to the function.
2. You should give each function a descriptive name. In general, the same rules that apply to variable names also apply to function names.
3. A function can send a value to the part of the program that executed it. The return type is the data type of the value that is sent from the function.
4. The body of a function is the set of statements that perform the functionâ€™s operation. They are enclosed in a set of braces.
