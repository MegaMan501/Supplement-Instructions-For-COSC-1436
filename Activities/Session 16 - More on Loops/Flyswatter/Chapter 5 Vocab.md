# Chapter 5 Vocabulary - Flyswater

| Vocab | Question |
| --- | --- |
| `_` | When the increment or decrement operator is placed before the operand (or to the operands left), the operator is being used in `______` mode. |
| `_` | The statement or block that is repeated is known as the `_______` of the loop. |
| `_` | To `_____` a value means to decrease it by one. |
| `_` | Each repetition of a loop is known as a(n) `________`. |
| `_` | A loop that evaluates its test expression before each repetition is a(n) `_________` loop. |
| `_` | To `___________` a value means to increase it by one. |
| `_` | A loop that evaluates its test expression after each repetition is a(n) `_______` loop. |
| `_` | A loop that does not have a way of stopping is a(n) `______` loop. |
| `_` | Inside the for loop's parentheses the first expression is the `______ ` , the second expression is the `_____` and the third expression is the `_____`.
| `_` | The `_____` statement causes a loop to skip the remaining statements in the current iteration. |
| `_` | A(n) `____ ____` is a sum of numbers that accumulates with each iteration of a loop. |
| `_` | What header file do you need to include in a program that performs file operations? |
| `_` | The `___` loop is ideal for situations that require a counter. |
| `_` | When the increment or decrement operator is placed after the operand (or to the operands right) the operator is being used in `_____` mode. |
| `_` | A(n) `______` is a variable that is initialized to some starting value usually zero, and then has numbers added to it in each iteration of a loop.|
| `_` | A(n) `______` is a special value that marks the end of a series of values. |
| `_` | The `____` loop always iterates at least once. |
| `_` | The `_____` and `______` loops will not iterate at all if their test expressions are false to start with. |
| `_` | A loop that is inside another is called a(n) `______` loop. |
| `_` | The `_____` statement causes a loop to terminate immediately. |

| `initialization`, `test`, `update` | Inside the for loop's parentheses the first expression is the `______ ` , the second expression is the `_____` and the third expression is the `_____`.
| `continue` | The `_____` statement causes a loop to skip the remaining statements in the current iteration. |

| `accumulator` | A(n) `______` is a variable that is initialized to some starting value usually zero, and then has numbers added to it in each iteration of a loop.|
| `sentinel` | A(n) `______` is a special value that marks the end of a series of values. |
| `do-while` | The `____` loop always iterates at least once. |
| `while` and `for` | The `_____` and `______` loops will not iterate at all if their test expressions are false to start with. |
| `nested` | A loop that is inside another is called a(n) `______` loop. |
| `break` | The `_____` statement causes a loop to terminate immediately. |
