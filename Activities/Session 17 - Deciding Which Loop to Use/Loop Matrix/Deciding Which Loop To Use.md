<!--
## The `while` loop is a conditional `pretest` loop.
* Iterates as long as certain condition exits.
* Validating input.
* Reading list of data terminated by a sentinel.

## The `do-while` loop is a conditional `post-test` loop.
* Always iterates at least once.
* Repeating a menu.

## The `for` loop is a `pretest` loop.
* Built-in expressions for  initializing, testing, and updating.
* Situations where the exact number of iterations is known.  -->
