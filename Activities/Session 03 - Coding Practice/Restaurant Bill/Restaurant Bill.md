# Restaurant Bill

Write a program that computes the tax and tip on a restaurant bill for a patron with
a $88.67 meal charge. The tax should be 6.75 percent of the meal cost. The tip should
be 20 percent of the total after adding the tax. Display the meal cost, tax amount, tip
amount, and total bill on the screen.

## Problem
```c++
// Headers
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

// Global variables
const double TAX_PERCENTAGE = 0.0675;
const double TIP_PERCENTAGE = 0.20;

int main()
{
	// patron's meal cost
    // holds the tax of the meal
    // holds the tip of the meal
    // total cost of meal

    // Calcutions for total after taxes and tips
    tax =
    tip =
    total =

    // Display the results


	//	Make sure we place the end message on a new line
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
```
