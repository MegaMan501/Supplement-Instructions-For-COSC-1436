# Comparing Arrays

Is this how you __compare__ arrays?

```c++
    int firstArray[] = { 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 };
    int secondArray[] = { 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 };
    if (firstArray == secondArray)
        cout << "The arrays are the same.\n";
    else
        cout << "The arrays are not the same.\n";
```
## Questions:
1. If yes, explain what this is doing?
2. If no, explain what is wrong and how you might compare arrays.

__Hint:__ Got to __Chapter 7__ and read about comparing arrays in section __7.7__
