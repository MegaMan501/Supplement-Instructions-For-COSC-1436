# Rotating Work Sheet: Movie data

Write a program that uses a structure named MovieData to store the following information about a movie:

```
    Title
    Director
    Year Released
    Running Time (in minutes)
```

The program should create two MovieData variables, store values in their members,
and pass each one, in turn, to a function that displays the information about the movie
in a clearly formatted manner.
