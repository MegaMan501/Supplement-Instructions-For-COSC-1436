# Bubble Sort Pseudo-Code

Write down Pseudo-Code for an Bubble sort algorithm.

## Pseudo-Code Problem:
```c++
/*
*       
*
*           What Goes Here?
*
*
*/
```

## Pseudo-Code Solution:
```c++
/*  
*   Do
*      Set swap flag to false.
*   
*       For count is set to each subscript in array from 0 through the
*                  next-to-last subscript
*          If array[count] is greater than array[count + 1]
*              Swap the contents of array[count] and array[count + 1].
*              Set swap flag to true.
*          End If.
*      
*       End For.
*   
*   While any elements have been swapped.
