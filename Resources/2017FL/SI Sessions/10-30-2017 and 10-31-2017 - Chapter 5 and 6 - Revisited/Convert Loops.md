# Covert the loops:

1. Convert the following while loop to a do-while loop:

```c++
int x = 1;

while (x > 0)
{
    cout << "enter a number: ";
    cin >> x;
}
```

2. Convert the following do-while loop to a while loop:

```c++
char sure;

do
{
    cout << "Are you sure you want to quit? ";
    cin >> sure;
} while (sure != 'Y' && sure != 'N');
```

3. Convert the following while loop to a for loop:

```c++
int count = 0;

while (count < 50)
{
    cout << "count is " << count << endl;
    count++;
}
```

4. Convert the following for loop to a while loop:

```c++
for (int x = 50; x > 0; x−−)
{
    cout << x << " seconds to go.\n";
}
```
