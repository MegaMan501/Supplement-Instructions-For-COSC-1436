# Peer Lessons Chapter 7 Book Problems (Pseudo-Code)
## 5. Monkey Business
A local zoo wants to keep track of how many pounds of food each of its three monkeys
eats each day during a typical week. Write a program that stores this information in a
two-dimensional 3 × 5 array, where each row represents a different monkey and each
column represents a different day of the week. The program should first have the user
input the data for each monkey. Then it should create a report that includes the
following information:
- Average amount of food eaten per day by the whole family of monkeys.
- The least amount of food eaten during the week by any one monkey.
- The greatest amount of food eaten during the week by any one monkey.

***Input Validation: Do not accept negative numbers for pounds of food eaten.***

## 12. Grade Book
A teacher has five students who have taken four tests. The teacher uses the following
grading scale to assign a letter grade to a student, based on the average of his or her
four test scores.

| Test Score | Letter Grade |
| --- | --- |
| 90–100 | A |
| 80–89  | B |
| 70–79  | C |
| 60–69  | D |
| 00–59  | F |


Write pseudo-code that uses an array of string objects to hold the five student names,
an array of five characters to hold the five students’ letter grades, and five arrays of
four double s to hold each student’s set of test scores.
The program should allow the user to enter each student’s name and his or her four
test scores. It should then calculate and display each student’s average test score and a
letter grade based on the average.

***Input Validation: Do not accept test scores less than 0 or greater than 100.***
