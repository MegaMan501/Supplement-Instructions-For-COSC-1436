# Range Base **for** loops

### What is a range base for loop?

The range-based **for** loop is a loop that iterates once for each element in
an array. Each time the loop iterates, it copies an element from the array
to a variable.

## Can you give an example?

```c++
    int numbers[] = { 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 };

    for (/*What Goes Here?*/)
    {
        /*What Goes Here?*/
    }
```

***The range-based for loop was introduced in C++ 11.***
